* `spotify-this-song`
This will show relevant information about the song in your terminal/bash window. It also returns a log text.
     
* `movie-this`
This will show relevant information about the movie in your terminal/bash window. It also returns a log text.

* `do-what-it-says`
LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.
